**Project Description**

This was a solo project to create a static comp of a sample webpage. As the layout featured a strong card-like focus I thought it would be fun to make wanted posters for fictional characters I've always disliked.This was a beginning development project for Turing's frontend program.

**Project Goals**

-   Create a responsive page layout with the use of HTML and CSS.
-   Given free rein with website copy, images, icons, and color palette.
-   Site must work across Firefox, Safari and Chrome.
-   Become familiar with the use of GitHub and branching when working on a paired project.
